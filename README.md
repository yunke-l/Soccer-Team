# Soccer-Team
Java course project at NEU, 2023 spring semester.


## Software specifications
### This software will be used by the head coach of a U10 soccer club to build a soccer team with starting lineup.
For every player, the user will enter the following information:
* Player's first name
* Player's last name
* Player's date of birth (only player's under ten years of age can be part of the team)
* Player's preferred position (goalie, defender, midfielder, forward)
* Skill level, which is a number between 1 and 5 based on the coach's assessment (1 = lowest skill level, 5 = highest skill level)
Each player will also have a jersey number but it will be assigned to them once the team is created.
The team must have a minimum of 10 players and a maximum of 20.
 
Once all the players' information has been entered, the software will automatically select the best players (according to their skill level and preferred position) to form the team and the startiglineup.
The user can select and remove players from the middle table and create new teams, as well as reset the status.
